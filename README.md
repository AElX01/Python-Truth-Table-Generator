Hi there, I'm Alex. I'm the developer of this project. To make the whole think work, just clone the repository and unzip the folder, once you're done, go to the "dist" folder and you'll find the executable there. Consider the following to use the application:

^: AND
V: OR
X: XOR
/: conditional
|: if and only if

Do not worry if you insert the expression with or without spaces but consider to ONLY USE the symbols that work there, else you won't be promped anything but an error message ;)
The generator supports from a to z variables. You'll also have the code in the .zip folder.
